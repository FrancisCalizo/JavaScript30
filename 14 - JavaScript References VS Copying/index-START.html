      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };
